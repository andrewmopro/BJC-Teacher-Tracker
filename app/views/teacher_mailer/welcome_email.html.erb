<b>Accessing the teacher's guide:</b><br>

To view the teacher's guide at <%= link_to nil, "https://bjc.edc.org/teacher" %>, you will need the username: <code>bjcteacher</code> and the case-sensitive password: <code>DeBUgg</code><br>
<br>
After you enter the password once it will be stored in a cookie for that browser; if you delete your browser cookies, you will need to reenter it. If you use this password on a computer that students also use, they will have access to these pages until you clear the cookies. <br>
