Hi <%= @teacher.first_name %>, <br>
<br>
To view <%= link_to nil, "bjc.edc.org/teacher" %>, you will need the username: bjcteacher and the case-sensitive password: DeBUgg <br>
<br>
After you enter the password once it will be stored in a cookie for that browser; if you delete your browser cookies, you will need to reenter it. If you use this password on a computer that students also use, they will have access to these pages until you clear the cookies. <br>
<br>
Please note that only the Teacher Guide lab pages are affected by this. Students will still be able to see the Teacher Guide course overview page, the Teacher Resources page, and the Teacher Guide unit overview pages. <br>
<br>
Thanks!
